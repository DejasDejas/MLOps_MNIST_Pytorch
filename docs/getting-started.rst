Getting started
===============

This project is a piece of a possible MLOps workflow that allows data scientist, researchers, students or independent developer to develop Machine Leaning project in Continuous Integration (CI) with most popular open-source or free tools.

In this project you can find help to:

* create a CNN with Pytorch Ignite,
* sanity tests for machine learning,
* monitor training and validation results with TensorBoard or Neptune,
* initialise a data science project with a good architecture (cookiecutter),
* save and store data on GDrive with DVC,
* versioning data and model with DVC,
* create a CI/CD loop with CML
